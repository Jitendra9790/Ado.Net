ASP.NET- Powerful tool for creating dynamic 
	 and interactive web pages.

       - Uses managed code for processing of web requests.

       - Helps you build powerful, secure and dynamic applications 
	 using least possible code.

       - Compiled .Net based environment(Applications run faster with more
	 design time errors trapped at development stage).

ASP.NET (VS) ASP - Good performance through compiled code(Applications run faster with more
	 	   design time errors trapped at development stage).
		 - Extensive set of controls and class libraries.
		 - Runtime error handling using try-catch blocks.
		 - Scalability(ability to increase output under increased load).
		 - Flexibility of using languages(C#, VB.NET).
		 - Caching facility.

Features of ASP.NET - Contains configuration files in xml format
		    - Ability to use code-behind development to separate business
		      logic from presentation.
		    - Web server controls.
		    - Default authorization and authentication schemes.
Bird's Eye View - ASP.NET is a collection of .Net classes that collaborate to process
		  HTTP request and generate HTTP response.
		- Classes are loaded from system assemblies, GAC(Global Assembly Cache),
		  and local assemblies.
		- Developers can choose web forms or web services.
Web Forms(.aspx file) - It allows you to build powerful form based web pages using
			asp.net controls.
Web Services(.asmx file) - It is a way to access server functionality remotely.

Flow in asp.net - A request starts on a browser where user types URL, or click hyperlinks
		  or submitting HTML forms.
		- It interfaces with IIS through ISAPI extension at lowest level.
		- Routes the request to appropriate handler which is responsible 
		  for handling requests.

Setting the .net version - We should not set extensions manually instead use aspnet_regiis.exe 
			   utility to ensure all scriptmaps get registered properly.

HTTP Handler - It is a process which runs in response to HTTP request.
Types of HTTP Handlers :-
1)ASP.NET Page Handler(.aspx) - Default handler for all asp.net pages.
2)Web Service Handler(.asmx) - Default handler for web service pages.
3)Generic Web Handler(.ashx) - Default handler for all web handlers that do not have UI.
4)Trace Handler(trace.axd) - Displays current page trace information.

HTTP Modules - It is an assembly that is called on every request that is 
	       made to your application.
