View State - Prevents users from losing data that they have entered into a form.
	   - All the entries and selections get retained.
	   - Persistence of data.

Life Cycle of ASP.NET - 

1)Pre-Init => Runtime setting of themes and master pages.
2)Init => Page Controls are initialised to default state.
3)LoadViewState => View State data is loaded.
4)LoadPostData => Info. posted by browsers is consumed here.
5)InitComplete => All the controls are completely initialised.
6)PreLoad => View State info. and post back data for declared controls are loaded.
7)Load => Iniliasation code is loaded at this stage.
8)Prerender => Any prerendering steps are carried out.
9)PreRenderComplete => Page is ready to render.
10)SaveViewState => View State of all the controls are serialized.
11)Render => Creates text and markup sent to client browser.
12)Unload => Code to close resources and cleanup.

PostBack - Values of the form are posted to the same page and the same page processes the data.
AutoPostBack - Automatically posts page back to the server whenever value of control is changed.
